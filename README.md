1) the value of filepath where the pics will be read from needs to be changed depending on your OS

2) accordingly, in the df.to_csv method , adjust the file path to where you want to create the CSV file ( and use format appropriate for your OS).  RECOMMEND creating the csv in the same folder in which the pics are.


3) create an appropriate csv filename that is descriptive of the contents.
